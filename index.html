<h1>Our History</h1>

    <p>When journalist Chea Evans was pushed out of small-town paper for her reporting, the community spoke out. Several board members resigned, and dozens of regular citizens, town leaders and members of the select, zoning boards praised her balanced and lively investigative reporting, and bemoaned the loss of an independent news source in town. They came together to support her work, creating a highly-reported newsletter, operated transparently, and committing to provide her reporting for free to all.</p>

<h1>  The core principles of journalism are not complex.</h1>
  <p>
    The core principles of journalism are not complex. They don’t require a massive organization or years of training. They are quite simple and boil down to one idea: when someone reads an article, they should feel confident that the piece was written in the public interest and not, secretly, in support of some private interest.</p>

<p>Journalists and managers of journalistic institutions are, of course, fallible like all human beings. They are capable of confusing their own, private, interests with those of the general public. So, journalistic best practice involves clear rules and policies that protect the reader and the integrity of the news product.</p>

<h2>Best Practices:</h2>

<p>Editorial independence. The editorial team, led by the editor, should be empowered to make all editorial decisions about what stories to cover and how to cover them. A news team needs to feel confident that they can report—fearlessly and fairly—on any topic they deem to be in the public interest. They must not fear interference or retribution. The publisher and board of directors sets the overall mission and long-term goals but does not interfere with the editorial product. If they have story ideas, corrections, or other suggestions, these are made in the same way any reader would.</p>

<p> Conflict of interest. If anybody might personally benefit—or is close to someone who might personally benefit—from a topic covered, they must recuse themselves from any discussion of that coverage. They make no story suggestions, edit suggestions, or in any way impact the coverage. We err on the side of overly disclosing potential conflict of interest.</p>

<p> Managing a news team. From time to time, reporters and editors may need to be reprimanded or, even, fired for their behavior in the workplace. However, in a journalistic institution, there is always a concern that the HR process is being used as retribution against news coverage or to silence an especially diligent news team. For this reason, HR processes in a news operation need to be especially well-handled in a deliberate and transparent manner to ensure there is no retribution or silencing or, even, the appearance of such editorial interference. As any journalist knows—one can build trust over decades and lose it in an afternoon.</p>

<p> Transparency. We believe deeply in transparency, and that there needs to be little division between the actions of the news operations and what the public sees.Local news works when news outlets operate under a policy of tenacity with transparency. Conflicts of interest are expected; they are surmountable when clear procedures and expectations are in place to avoid biased reporting.</p>

<p>Our goal is to create a news organization with as much transparency as possible. This means keeping our code open source on GitHub, and disclosing financial information, including donors, operating costs, and salaries; it also means having a system in place for editorial staff to relay conflict-of-interest concerns to board members.</p>
